Language used : 

 	       In our selenium project, we have used Core java as scripting languege to create test scripts.
Though Selenium provide support to many languages , we have used core java as most of our resources were having knowledge
of core java.


Type of Framework: 
	
		In our project , we have created hybrid framework using Page Object Model desgin pattern with Page Factory.

Page Object Model :

		I our project , we have maintained each class for each Web Page.Each Web page is having seperate class and member functions related to particular web page.
		And there are separate test class for individual test.
		

Packages :

		In our project , we have seperate packages for Pages and Tests. All web page related classes comes under pages package and All test related clasess comes 
		under Tests package.
		Examples : LoginPage and HomePage classes comes under Pages package and LoginPageTest and HomePageTest classes comes under Tests Package.
		LoginPageTest class will call few methods from LoginPage class and HomePageTest class will call few methods from HomePage and LoginPage classes to create 
		login test for given website.

TestBase Class :

		In our project, TestBase class is parent class of all classes as it consists setUp() which is having  WebDriver instance, implicite wait , Properties Object,
		FileINputSteram , ExtendReport.
		Every class extends TestBase class to inherit properties of TestBase class.

	

Utility Class :

		Utility Class also known as Function class. This class stored and handles functions such as Actions , Capturing Screenshots , waits,Reading and writing Excel files,
		In general common to framework to achieve reusability.

Proerpties File :
 
 		This files stores information which is static to entire framework such as Login credentiels , Applcaition URL, Browser specific information , screenshot path.
		keeping these details in seperate file make easier to maintain data.



Screenshots    :

		This folder stores screenshot taken by existing utility.

TestData       :
     
		This folder stores historical test data in form of excel sheets. By using this sheet we pass data to test cases to achieve data drivern approach.
		We often use Apache POI to handle excel sheets.

TestNG	       :
  
              We have used TestNG  for assertions , annotations to manage test suite and we have achieved Parallel execution.

Maven          :

		We have used Maven for build , execution and maintaining dependencies for different libraries used in project.


Version Control Tool :

		We have used Git to store scripts created on daily basis.


Jenkins 	:

		Using Jenkins , we were executing tests on daily basis. Also we had scheduled for nightly execution using Jenkins.


ExtentReports :

		We are using ExtentReport to generate very systematic HTML , XML or JSON reporting.
